    "have told you that these men from far-off nations may well claim the honor of bearing to different lands the idea of toleration. \n",
    "I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true. \n",

    "# Errors in Stemming:\n",
    "## There are mainly two errors in stemming –\n",
    "### 1) over-stemming - When two words are stemmed to same root that are of different stems. Over-stemming can also be regarded as false-positives.\n",
    "#### eg:- Whereas for example \"organization\" as well as \"organs\" are both stemmed to \"organ\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) under-stemming - When two words are stemmed to same root that are not of different stems. Under-stemming can be interpreted as false-negatives.\n",
    "#### eg:-the following two terms of same origin \"absorption\" and \"absorbing\" are stemmed to \"absorpt\" and \"absorb\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications\n",
    "## 1) Stemming is used in information retrieval systems like search engines.\n",
